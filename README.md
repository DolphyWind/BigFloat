# BigFloat
Arbitrary-Precision Floating Point Arithmetic Library.  
Implements a C++ class that allows you to create floats of arbitrary size, with no limit on integer digits and selectable limit on fractional digits.  
This data structure can be handy when you want to avoid overflow or for accurate division.

## Usage
Simple makefile:
  * Makefile

Library files:
  * BigFloat.h
  * BigFloat.cpp

Examples of library usage:
  * Test.cpp
  * Factorial.cpp
